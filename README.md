### Big Sky Code Academy: Data Science ###

Notes:
  - Recommend 26 week program with 9-12 hours contact time per week (i.e. three
    three hour sessions or four three hour sessions)
  - I recommended breaking up topics into seven three-week units, each building
    upon the last. Week one can focus mostly on theoretical introduction, while
    week two can then transition into turning theory to workshop implementation.
    The third week of each unit could then focus upon a given project for a key
    topic from each unit (i.e. linear regression, k-means clustering, recurrent
    neural networks). The final five weeks can be reserved for individual data
    analysis projects.
  - Initial student requirements should be basic proficiency with derivative and
    some integral calculus, as well as some prior exposure to basic statistical
    methods. Students possessing basic knowledge of linear algebra (i.e. what
    a matrix even is, how matrix dimension are represented) should be strongly
    preferred. Programming requirements should be at *least* a full year's
    experience with Python or a similar programming language. If the applicant
    is proficient in another language but doesn't know Python, the student
    should complete either the online CodeAcademy Python course or Udacity's
    CS101 mook.
  - Applicants should be tested on both their proficiency with Python and with
    the required base mathematics. They should be able to efficiently wield
    functions, list comprehensions, Python lists, Python dictionaries, and
    possibly even generator functions.
  - I personally recommend marketing the course as a solid *introduction* to
    Data Science. After the course, students will understand the base models,
    concepts, and methods of data analysis and modeling. They should be able to
    at least obtain a job as a junior data analyst (note that data analyst
    positions usually require the applicant to have a Bachelors in some other
    degree). I would target this program at recent university graduates, current
    university students, or existing professionals looking to make the leap to
    data science (i.e. a career switch).
  - For a full-time course, I'd recommend units be seven two-week sessions, with
    four-weeks for personal projects (totaling eighteen weeks). The reason for
    the extended period is to allot for the sheer difficulty of many of the data
    science methods and concepts.
  - I'll gladly head up more of the theoretical/math bent, and add in as much on
    the Tensorflow tip for neural networks as possible. Scipy and Numpy are
    sufficient for almost everything else.
  - Consider this repo a dump to pilfer exercises from.
